# Using Keystone's API from a Web App

There are two main features of Keystone that you can leverage in building an app. The first is the
Admin UI, a fully-featured schema-driven admin UI. The second is the schema-driven graphql API,
which this walkthrough is going to go through using.

For this walkthrough, we are going to start from an existing keystone project with a simple schema
for a todo list, and build out a single page frontend for our todos, then add functionality to mark
to-dos as done from our web app.

> Looking for an introduction on setting up Keystone, including setting up a schema?
> [this walkthrough series](https://keystonejs.com/docs/walkthroughs/lesson-1) is a good place to start

## Technology choices

You can access Keystone's graphql API using anything that can make a fetch request, including basic
fetch functions. For this walkthrough, we'll be showing how to set up queries using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and
[apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/). If you have a preferred frontend library, or graphql query library,
the learnings here will help you out in those places.

For much of the next/react code, we'll provide you with existing code, so we can stay focused on
learning about making graphql queries with keystone.

## A new foundation

For this walkthrough, we're going to give you a starting project, which has keystone set up with a schema.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-frontend-example.git
```

This will give us a `keystone.ts` file with a basic config, as well as a next app basic setup that renders a todo page ready for us to add code.

Once you've got the starting code, run

```shell
yarn
```

to install your dependencies, and then run

```shell
yarn dev --seed-data
```

Which will give us a nice base set of

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will seed the database with some existing users and to-dos

You should now be able to visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the admin UI, and more
importantly, you can now access the graphql playground, findable at
[localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql).

End the terminal process, and let's add next.js.

## A whirlwind fast next.js setup

```shell
yarn add @apollo/client @keystone-6/core graphql next react react-dom
yarn add --dev typescript npm-run-all
touch pages/index.tsx
```

Open `pages/index.tsx` in your editor of choice and add:

```ts
import React from 'react';

export default () => <div>Hello Keystone Dev!</div>
```

## Running the next app as well

For development, we are going to want to run next alongside our keystone app.
If we start our next app while our keystone app is running, it will be smart and run on port `3001`,
however we want to make aconsistent relationship between the two, so that the next app has a consistent
place to find keystone and connect with it. The best option here is to manually pick a port for keystone
to be served on. In our `keystone.ts` file. we can tell keystone what port we want it to start on:

```ts{8-10}[1-4]
import { config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { lists } from './schema';
import { db } from './database-config'

export default config({
  db,
  lists,
  server: {
    port: 3001,
  },
});
```

Now, we can open two terminal windows. In one we can run:

```shell
yarn keystone dev
```

and in the second terminal we can run:

```shell
yarn next dev
```

With both of these running, we can now access [localhost:3001/api/graphql](http://localhost:3001/api/graphql) for the graphql API, and then we can find our frontend on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Improving the Dev Experience

Since we are effectively working on only one app consisting of a frontend and backend, we ideally only want to run one command to start up both processes.

To do this, we are going to use [npm-run-all](TODO):

```shell
yarn add --dev npm-run-all
```

Next we need to add some scripts to our `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@keystone-6/example-task-manager",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "seed-data": "keystone --seed-data",
    "keystone:dev": "keystone dev",
    "next:dev": "next dev",
    "dev": "run-p *:dev"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@keystone-6/core": "^1.0.0",
    "graphql": "^15.8.0",
    "next": "^12.0.7",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
    "typescript": "^4.4.4"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "^14.15 || ^16.13"
  },
}
```

> The versions are up-to-date when this was written - if you are using more recent versions of packages that should be a-ok

Now you can get your app running with just with:

```shell
yarn dev
```

which will start both the next process and the keystone process.

## Connecting the frontend to keystone

Our next step along our app journey is to connect our frontend to Keystone's graphql API, so we can render the information. As we mentioned earlier,
we'll be using apollo, so let's install that:

```
yarn add @apollo/client graphql
```

### Adding our apollo provider

With The apollo client and graphql installed, we need to set up the apollo provider. We are going to want to set
this up in a new file, `src/pages/_app.tsx` - this file is responsible for global config in next. This is the best
place to put an apollo provider so it will be accessible to all next pages.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: process.env.GRAPHQL_API || 'http://localhost:3001/api/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  credentials: 'same-origin',
});

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

> We are looking to do a bit of future-proofing here. For deployment, we would need to provide an environment variable for the
> graphql endpoint, but we can default it to http://localhost:3001/api/graphql for local development

This finishes the config set-up on next's side. Now we need to do some config in keystone land.

### Changing Keystone's CORS

Keystone is pretty strict by default on how it handles cross-origin requests by default, but we want to allow our next frontend
to make requests freely to keystone.

```ts{10-12}[1-4]
import { config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { lists } from './schema';
import { db } from './database-config'

export default config({
  db,
  lists,
  server: {
    port: 3001,
    cors: {
        origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && '*',
    },
  },
});
```

Once again, we are using an environment variable. In development mode, we are happy to set the `cors.origin` to `*`,
however we would want to be more selective if we were to deploy this app, and have made cors permissive only in development mode..

## Making our first query

Now that the config is complete, we should make a query to ensure that it's all working.

Open the file `src/pages/index.tsx` - this file is where we will be working for the rest of this lesson series.

Currently it should look like:

```ts
import React from 'react';

export default () => <div>Hello Keystone Dev!</div>
```

So let's get something more interesting on the page.

For our test query, we're simply going to get the count of items.If we open the graphql explorer, found at http://localhost:3001/api/graphql,
and look in the `DOCS` tab on the right, we can see that keystone allows us to get the count of items in a list. A query for tasks would look like:

```graphql
query countQuery {
  tasksCount
}
```

however in this instance, we want to be a little more specific: we want just the items that are still to be complete.
Keystone has an easy answer for this as it provides `where` properties for filtering on any field:

```graphql
query countQuery {
  tasksCount(where: { isComplete: { equals: true } })
}
```

Now that we know what our query looks like, we need to put it into our file, so we can execute it. We want to use
the `gql` helper from apollo to make this easier:

```tsx{3,5-9}
import React from 'react';
import { Divider } from '../components';
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

const countQuery = gql`
query countQuery {
  tasksCount(where: { isComplete: { equals: true } })
}
`

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>still to do: {'oh no what is it?'}</div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
      <div>To-do: display our todos</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Finally, we need to run the query. We are going to use the `useQuery` hook from apollo:

```tsx{3,12,13}
import React from 'react';
import { Divider } from '../components';
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const countQuery = gql`
query countQuery {
  tasksCount(where: { isComplete: { equals: true } })
}
`

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(countQuery)
    console.log({ data, loading, error })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>still to do: {'oh no what is it?'}</div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
      <div>To-do: display our todos</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Just to check that it's working, we've just added a console log to check in on the output of the query.
Let's check in on the frontend and make sure it's all working. Cool!

Finally, let's handle rendering the count. We want to handle when the data is still loading, or if
there is an error, so we'll quickly add early returns in those cases:

```tsx{14-25}[1-10]
import React from 'react';
import { Error } from '../components';
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const countQuery = gql`
query countQuery {
  tasksCount(where: { isComplete: { equals: true } })
}
`

export default function Index() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(countQuery)

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error || !data) {
    return <Error error={error} />;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>still to do: {'oh no what is it?'}</div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
      <div>To-do: display our todos</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And at last, rendering the count:

```tsx{29}[1-10,14-25]
import React from 'react';
import { Divider } from '../components';
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const countQuery = gql`
query countQuery {
  tasksCount(where: { isComplete: { equals: true } })
}
`

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(countQuery)

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
        <div>still to do: {data.tasksCount}</div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
      <div>To-do: display our todos</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Fantastic! We are now hitting the Keystone API, and rendering the count of items still to do.

## Rendering our Todos

Now that we've confirmed the Keystone API is running, let's get our todos themselves, and render them.

Before we add any code to our project, let's head to the graphql explorer to form our new query. For now, we are going
to just get all todos, and we want to be able to display their priority, whether they are done, and the label for the to-do.

```graphql
query getTasks {
    tasks(orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]) {
        id
        priority
        isComplete
        label
    }
}
```

> Keystone adds a query type for each list to get one item, or, like here, get many items. Using the graphql exploerer you can look at the type signatures for all available queries

Execute our new query and check it's giving us what we want, great!

Okay, we've decided the count query isn't that useful, so we're going to remove the count from our app, and replace it with performing our new query:

```tsx{5-14}[1-4,19-32]
import React from 'react';
import { Divider } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
query getTasks {
    tasks(orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]) {
        id
        priority
        isComplete
        label
    }
}
`

export default function Index() {
  // We've replaced the countQuery with our new tasksQuery
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)

    if (loading) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error || !data) {
      return (
      <div>
          <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
          <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
      </div>
      );
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
      <div>To-do: display our todos</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

For displaying them, we are going to use an existing component we can import, `TodoItem`.

```tsx{2}[4-1000]
import React from 'react';
import { TodoItem } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
  query getTasks {
    tasks(orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]) {
      id
      priority
      isComplete
      label
    }
  }
`

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
      <div>To-do: display our todos</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

From here, we can map over our data to render todo items:

```tsx{35-38}[1-4,18-31]
import React from 'react';
import { TodoItem } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
  query getTasks {
    tasks(orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]) {
      id
      priority
      isComplete
      label
    }
  }
`

TODO pick up from here

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
            {data.tasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem} />
        ))}
      <Divider />
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Done! 🏖</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Great! We've now got all our to-do items rendering, but we want to sort them into two groups for done items and not-done items:

```tsx{36,42-46}[1-4,18-31]
import React from 'react';
import { Divider, TodoItem } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
  query getTasks {
    tasks(orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]) {
      id
      priority
      isComplete
      label
    }
  }
`

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
            {data.tasks
            .filter(task => !task.isComplete)
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem} />
        ))}
      <Divider />
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Done! 🏖</h2>
                  {data.tasks
            .filter(task => !task.isComplete)
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem} />
        ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

And that's the rendering done

## Making a smarter query

This is a bit of a bonus over our last step. In our last step, we're performing two filters on the list to get the subsets of items. It would be good to move this logic back into the query itself, and thankfully with keystone and graphql we can, using the `where` field, and filtering by `isComplete:

```graphql
query getTasks {
  incompleteTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
  completeTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
}
```

Once we swap this query out on the frontend, we can just write:

```tsx{5-28,31}[1-4,32-45]
import React from 'react';
import { Divider, TodoItem } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
query getTasks {
  incompleteTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
  completeTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
}
`

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
        <div>still to do: {data.tasksCount}</div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
            {data.incompleteTasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem} />
        ))}
      <Divider />
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Done! 🏖</h2>
                  {data.completeTasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem} />
        ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This query, instead of returning a single array for tasks, returns two different variables with the different filtered lists we want.

## Updating the status of items

Now that we've got items split into two lists, it's time to add a bit of interaction to our list. We're not going to make a fully-functional frontend in this lesson, instead we just want to allow people to mark if a task is completed, and have it update both the database entry and the frontend.

When we update an item, we need a piece of unique information about that item. Here, that will be the ID. Next, we need to update the `isComplete` field, and finally, we want to set the `finishedBy` property. If the item is being completed, this should be set to `now`, otherwise if a task is being marked as no longer done, it should be cleared.

Turning back to our graphql playground, we can write a mutation for this:

```graphql
  mutation updateATask($id: ID, $isComplete: Boolean, $finishedBy: DateTime) {
    updateTask(where: { id: $id }, data: { isComplete: $isComplete, finishBy: $finishedBy }) {
      isComplete
      id
      finishBy
    }
  }
```

| Including the return signature here makes sure the apollo cache for the item gets updated

Using the `query variables` in the playround, you can check that this query works. (you'll need to get the ID of one of your items to do so)

### Calling the mutation

Now that we have a mutation, we want to add this to our frontend. The `TodoItem` component has a property for `onCheckboxChange` which we can use. We'll be using the `useMutation` hook from apollo. Let's add the hook in first.

```tsx{3,30-38,42-45,66-74}[1-2,4-29]
import React from 'react';
import { Divider, TodoItem } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
query getTasks {
  incompleteTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
  completeTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
}
`

const mutation = gql`
  mutation updateATask($id: ID, $isComplete: Boolean, $finishedBy: DateTime) {
    updateTask(where: { id: $id }, data: { isComplete: $isComplete, finishBy: $finishedBy }) {
      isComplete
      id
      finishBy
    }
  }
`;

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)
      const [updateDoneStatus] = useMutation<
    any,
    { id: string; finishedBy: string; isComplete: boolean }
  >(mutation);

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
            {data.incompleteTasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem}
                      onCheckboxChange={() =>
              updateDoneStatus({
                variables: {
                  id: todoItem.id,
                  finishedBy: new Date().toISOString(),
                  isComplete: true,
                },
              })
            }
          />
        ))}
      <Divider />
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Done! 🏖</h2>
                  {data.completeTasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem} />
        ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Great, we can now check out this working - go to the frontend and try and checking off the an item.

Neat! Our final bit of code, we want to add unticking items from the list.

```tsx{0,83-91}[1-39,46-59]
import React from 'react';
import { Divider, TodoItem } from '../components'
import { gql, useQuery, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const tasksQuery = gql`
query getTasks {
  incompleteTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
  completeTasks: tasks(
    orderBy: [{ finishBy: desc }]
    where: { isComplete: { equals: false } }
  ) {
    id
    priority
    isComplete
    finishBy
    label
  }
}
`

const mutation = gql`
  mutation updateATask($id: ID, $isComplete: Boolean, $finishedBy: DateTime) {
    updateTask(where: { id: $id }, data: { isComplete: $isComplete, finishBy: $finishedBy }) {
      isComplete
      id
      finishBy
    }
  }
`;

export default function Index() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(tasksQuery)
      const [updateDoneStatus] = useMutation<
    any,
    { id: string; finishedBy: string; isComplete: boolean }
  >(mutation);

      if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    if (error || !data) {
        return (
        <div>
            <div>We had an error contacting the Keystone server - make sure it's up and running.</div>
            <div>Error message: {error?.message}</div>
        </div>
        );
    }

  return (
    <div>
        <div>still to do: {data.tasksCount}</div>
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>To-Do 💻</h2>
            {data.incompleteTasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem}
                      onCheckboxChange={() =>
              updateDoneStatus({
                variables: {
                  id: todoItem.id,
                  finishedBy: new Date().toISOString(),
                  isComplete: true,
                },
              })
            }
          />
        ))}
      <Divider />
      <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Done! 🏖</h2>
                  {data.completeTasks
        .map(todoItem => (
          <TodoItem {...todoItem}
                    onCheckboxChange={() =>
            updateDoneStatus({
              variables: {
                id: todoItem.id,
                finishedBy: null,
                isComplete: false,
              },
            })
          }
          />
        ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Where to now?

We've now covered off a bunch of learnings:

- Connecting a next app to keystone using apollo
- Making queries to keystone's graphql API
- Tying this in to our frontend
- creating mutations

Before we leave you, let's talk about some other things that you could explore with this app to improve it further:

Locally, responses will always be quick, but we should handle the loading state for the mutation.

We've got a few places where we are specifying environment variables for deployment - we could shore up these areas more to be safer.

Currently this frontend app can mark items as done/not done, but we might want to allow editing other properties, such as the priority or the text.

In nextjs, we could move the graphql query to a server-side request so we could statically render the page.

We could add [ts-gql](https://github.com/Thinkmill/ts-gql), which plays nicely with keystone to give us inbuilt type inference from the types generated by keystone on our frontend.

---

The starting code:
A keystone app with a seed script and a TODO app schema (no permissions)

We will cover:

Installations
Running two scripts side-by-side
keystone config to make this nice (PORT and CORS)
Setting up the apollo client to the correct location of the keystone admin UI
Querying for the data

    you'll be given code blocks for the data display logic, lesson will focus on they query bits

Calling a graphql mutation to update the data

The end state:
We have a single page displaying to-dos and their priority.
We can update the status of a to-do if it is done or not done

Next steps/alternatives/further readying
Loading states for updating
Environment variables for cors etc
UI for updating priority, text, etc from the frontend
Keystone setup of 'thinkmill standard' (using ts-gql for types logic, sort out server-side rendering)

TODO: build initial project to clone
TODO: initial project
TODO: move db settings into a separate folder
